# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    Challenge1 Project Overview
### Purpose
    The purpose of this project is to get us familiar with the basics of using excel as well as get more familiar with more advanced techniques in order to use data that we are gathering and format it into easier information.
## Analysis and Challenges
    I found this challenge to be a little easy which was to be expected. I also have an extensive backround with excel and I am quite comfortable and familiar with pivot tables. There were some challenges with the second part of the challenge and getting the formula to be right. I wasnt able to mass produce the formula so I had to manually edit the formula for each cell which became very tedious but I was able to get it worked out in the end.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    This was a very fun activity to complete and I really enjoyed being able to take raw information from a table and use it to produce a pivot table as well as make a line chart for this.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    This one was also quite fun as well as had a harder difficulty to getting it solved because of the different formula needed for each cell.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    For this challenege I didnt encounter many difficulties as I have a backround with using excel and applying pivot tables to data. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    For the two conclustions I would come to when looking at the data would be:
    There are twice the amount of successful to failed outcomes
    The two months of most successful outcomes were May and June
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    My conclusion the information gatherered from outcomes based on goals is that with higher goal amount there were increased percentage for failure
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Some of the limitations for this dataset are that you are only looking at raw data and there could be many more influences on why there was sucess and failure rate
    Also the information we were also looking at was very specific and instead of looking at only the data for plays we could have broadened the scope of the search
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    There are many more tables that could be created instead of subcategory for plays we could broaden the search to all of the categories or to each individual category to make a chart and graph for each to get a solid dataset of information
